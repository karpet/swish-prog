Revision history for Perl extension Prog.

0.01  Tue Nov 22 21:54:37 2005
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.22 with options
		-XA -n Prog

0.02	POD fixes
        added merge() add() and mv() methods to S::P::Index
          and t/3merge.t and t/4add.t
        added 2 more test docs
        added format() accessor to S::P::Index
        changed S::P::I to use Class::Accessor::Fast
          since we don't need to override get/set
        S::P now always inits an indexer even if fh=>0
        added private _index_methods to S::P


0.03    * removed all mentions of SWISH3
        * test indexes are removed as part of 'make clean'
        * switched from Data::Dumper to Data::Dump
        * added new SWISH::Prog::Object example
        * fixed bug in SWISH::Prog::Headers to test defined() 
          rather than simply eval true/false
        * fixed bug in SWISH::Prog::DBI with accepting DBI handle
          in init()
        * changed to using IO::All instead of File::stat and File::Slurp
          for better UTF8 support
        * changed default order of init() and init_indexer() to work
          more intuitively. Fixed S::P::DBI accordingly.
          To prevent an indexer from being init'd (as in 0.02) simply
          override init_indexer() and don't call SUPER::init_indexer().
        * new feature: SWISH::Prog::Find
        * renamed meta() to table_meta() in SWISH::Prog::DBI for clarity.
        * S::P::Config now always handles config params as arrays
        * Config metanames() propertynames() and propertynamesnostripchars() 
          are no longer available 
        * S::P::Config now requires IO::All and Config::General; added read2() method.
        * new feature placeholder: SWISH::Prog::Spider
        
0.04    * S::P::DBI no longer calls disconnect() on db handle in DESTROY
        * fixed bug with auto-defining metanames
        * S::P::Config always returns arrayref on directive method calls
        * use MIME::Types instead of File::Type
        * S::P::Find now uses File::Find instead of Path::Class::Iterator
        * S::P::Object obj_filter() must return an object of some kind
        * S::P::Object will not dump() scalar strings, thus avoiding extra quotes
        * S::P::Config added stringify() method and reverted from IO::All to File::Slurp
        * S::Prog added elapsed() method
        * S::Prog new() verbose now defaults to 1

0.05    * S::P::Object now uses JSON or YAML to serialize values instead of Data::Dump
          This change is sync'd with SWISH::API::Object 0.0.6

0.06    * S::P::Object now defers to explicit 'config' passed in new().

0.07    * S::P::Object iterator now uses more idiomatic while/next algorithm.

0.08    22 Nov 2007
        * added S::P::Mail class and example swishmail.pl script
        * sync all $VERSION vars to same value

        * add test_mode feature (set with SWISH_TEST env var)

        * fix bug in Config where $append flag was being interpreted as a MetaName/Property
        * fix bug in Config where ver2_to_ver3 was calling $self->new instead of $class->new

0.37    01 Feb 2010
        * add -D '\x03' to the Native::Indexer exec command. This mimics libswish3.
        * examples/swish3 now installed by default with usual make install.
        * added -N option to swish3, along with ok_if_newer_than feature in Aggregator.
        * added dependency on Rose::DateTime.
        * Native Indexer can now merge() and add().
        * -l and -M options now supported in swish3
        * yank Query.pm and QueryParser.pm. They weren't used and the idea is now fleshed
          out in Search::Query if we ever need it.

        * add fix for systems using Swish-e 2.6, which doesn't create a index.swish-e file.
        * remove the requires_external_bin from Makefile.PL since KSx and Xapian do not require
          swish-e but do require SWISH::Prog. Fix tests (which also check for swish-e) to SKIP
          the correct number of tests.

0.40    09 Feb 2010
        * make -D '\x03' optional in Native::Indexer based on which version of swish-e
          is available. The -D feature is only in 2.4.8 or newer.

0.41    10 Feb 2010
        * fix the check_swish() feature in Native::Indexer to only return the version number,
          not the whole output of swish-e -V (fixes the -D fix in 0.40).

0.42    27 Feb 2010

        * remove docs and method for 'sort_order' in abstract Searcher class. No subclass uses it,
          deferring to 'order' in the search() method opts.
        * FS->crawl now returns count
        * add MailFS aggregator class

0.44    19 Mar 2010

        * enable -H option in swish3
        * SWISH::3->slurp optimization now uses transparent gunzip feature. Requires SWISH::3 >= 0.06.

0.46    22 June 2010
        * add dep on Search::Query
        * add default_boolop feature to Native::Searcher
        * fix IncludeConfigFile recursionin Config->ver2_to_ver()

        * refactor FileRules feature into File::Rules module

0.50    22 Feb 2011
        * make swish3 -N flag argument optional, defaulting to indexdir/swish_last_start
        * error check in base Indexer for valid invindex param
        * misc doc fixes

0.51    28 June 2011
