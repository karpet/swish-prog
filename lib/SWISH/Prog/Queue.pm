=head1 NAME

SWISH::Prog::Queue - simple in-memory FIFO queue class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use SWISH::Prog::Queue;
 my $queue = SWISH::Prog::Queue->new;
 
 $queue->put( 'foo' );
 $queue->size;          # returns number of items in queue (1)
 $queue->peek;          # returns 'foo' (next value for get())
 $queue->get;           # returns 'foo' and removes it from queue

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SWISH::Prog::Queue is basically a Perl array, but it defines an API
that can be implemented using any kind of storage and logic you want.
One example would be a database that tracks items to be evaluated, or a flat
file list.

=head1 METHODS

See SWISH::Prog::Class.
