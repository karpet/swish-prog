=head1 NAME

SWISH::Prog::Native::InvIndex - the native Swish-e index format

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # see SWISH::Prog::InvIndex

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Native InvIndex represents the index.swish-e files.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 init

Sets file() to default index file name C<index.swish-e> unless
it is already set. If already set, confirms that file() is a child
of path().

=cut

sub init {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->SUPER::init(@_);
    if ( !$self->file ) {
        $self->file( $self->path->file('index.swish-e') );
    }
    else {

        # TODO check that ->file is child of ->path

    }

}

=head2 file

Returns a Path::Class::File object representing the main index file.

=head2 open

Creates path() if not already existent.

Since the native swish-e behaviour is to always create a temp index
and then rename it on close(), the clobber() attribute is effectively
ignored (always true).

=cut

sub open {
    my $self = shift;

    if ( -f $self->path ) {
        croak $self->path . " is not a directory.";
    }

    if ( !-d $self->path ) {

        #carp "mkpath $self->{path}";
        $self->path->mkpath($self->verbose);
    }

    1;
}
